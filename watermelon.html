    <p><b>Watermelon</b> is grown in favorable climates from tropical to temperate regions worldwide for its <br>
    large edible fruit, which is a berry with a hard rind and no internal divisions, and is botanically <br>
    called a pepo. The sweet, juicy flesh is usually deep red to pink, with many black seeds, although <br>
    seedless varieties exist. The fruit can be eaten raw or pickled, and the rind is edible after cooking. <br>
    It may also be consumed as a juice or an ingredient in mixed beverages.
